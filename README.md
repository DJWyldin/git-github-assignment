# git-github-assignment
# This repo is my Git & GitHub lab. I practiced cloning a repo, making branches, committing changes, and merging them. I also learned how to use pull requests and had to fix an authentication issue by using a personal access token. Overall, it helped me understand how teams manage and share code.
